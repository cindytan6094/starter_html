            <p>This meal is a cheap and easy alternative to the classic cheap college meal: ramen noodles. It cooks up in about 10
            minutes, and offers a ton of flavor and a more filling alternative to the typical packaged food. There is also plenty of
            room for culinary freedom and expression by adding extra sauces or spices, and substituting the pork for something like
            chicken for a healthier protein option.</p>

            <h3>Recipe Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup chili garlic sauce</li>

                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>

                <li>2 3oz. packages ramen noodles (seasoning packets discarded)</li>
                <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted peanuts, chopped</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Allow the pork and peanuts to simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce has reduced by half.</li>
                <li>While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, add your noodles and cook according tothe package directions.</li>
                <li>Drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
                <li>Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add the noodles to the skillet and toss until everything is combined and coated in sauce.</li>

            <p>
              My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at
              Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her
              siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.
              Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.

            <p>White sauce pasta is a creamy and savory dish that can be enjoyed for either lunch or dinner.

This union of two cultures allows for the perfect balance between each component of the recipe, creating a fulfilling entree that every individual can enjoy.</p>

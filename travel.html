            <p>In the village of Giverny, France, Monet’s garden is a sanctuary that inspired the paintings of Claude Monet. Monet's garden helped him determine the subjects of his paintings, as he drew inspiration from the pond and surrounding flowers in his impressionist works. Common nature-related themes from Monet’s garden became a recurring motif throughout all of his works.</p> 
            <p>The garden is divided into the Clos Normand flower garden and the Japanese water garden. The Clos Normand consists of flowers arranged in a formal manner, while the Japanese water garden consists of lilies and a water bridge that inspired a lot of Monet’s water related works. </p>

            <h2>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</h2>
            <img src="images/pictured_rocks.jpeg" alt="main image" />
            <p>
                Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore,
                is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful
                Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly
                100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured
                Rocks! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)
              </p>
              <p>
                No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured
                Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required).
                Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is
                from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the
                Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view
                the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state
                regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings
                otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing,
                skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check
                road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the
                winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail! (source:
